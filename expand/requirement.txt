Exercise 52. (90’) In a source file called expand.c or expand.cc, write a C or C++ program that
copies its standard input to its standard output replacing some strings in the input as specified
by a set of rules. A rule, denoted p → t, is defined by a pattern strings p and a replacement text
t, and specifies that every occurrence of pattern p in the input must be replaced with text t in the
output. For example, with the rule “Hello”→“Ciao” and the input “Hello World!”, the program
must output “Ciao World!”.
The program reads a sequence of rules from one or more files. The file names are given as
command-line arguments. With no arguments, the program reads the default file RULES. A rule
p → t is written in a file as a line “p:t”. You may assume that lines are at most 2000 characters
long. A text t that consists of multiple lines continues on multiple lines in the rules file with each
of the continuing lines starting with a colon. Lines that do not contain a colon character must be
ignored. See the example below:
rules file rules
poem:Tyger Tyger, burning bright,
:In the forests of the night;
:What immortal hand or eye,
:Could frame thy fearful symmetry?
:
ciao:hello
these two lines will be ignored
the following text is empty
empty text:
“poem” → “Tyger Tyger, burning bright,\n
In the forests of the night;\n
What immortal hand or eye,\n
Could frame thy fearful symmetry?\n”
“ciao” → “hello”
“empty text” → “”
Notice that a pattern may not contain any new-line or colon (:) character, and may not be empty.
Conversely, the replacement text may contain any character, including new-line and colon, and it
may also be empty.
Should any error occur while reading a rules file f , the program must print the error message
“invalid rules file f ” and then terminate immediately with the exit status EXIT_FAILURE. The
exist status must otherwise be EXIT_SUCCESS. (EXIT_SUCCESS and EXIT_FAILURE are defined in
stdlib.h.)
The rules are applied in the order given in the rules files. That is, if multiple rules are applicable
at any point in the input, the program applies the first applicable rule. For example, with the rules
“Hello”→“Ciao” and “Hell”→“Inferno” given in this order in a rules file, and with the input
“Hello darkness, my old friend”, the output must be “Ciao darkness, my old friend”.
Notice that the input “Hello darkness. . . ” matches the pattern of both rules. Had the rules been
given in the inverse order, the output would have been “Infernoo darkness, my old friend”.
The application of rules is mutually exclusive and non-recursive. This means that, when a rule is
applied to some pattern in the input and therefore that pattern is replaced with the corresponding
text in the output, neither the pattern nor the replacement text, nor any input before the pattern,
are considered further for the application of any rule. For example, given the rules “A”→“ASA”,
“I”→“ISI”, and “SANI”→“”, the input “ANIMA” is transformed into the output “ASANISIMASA”, and
the input “SANITY” is transformed into “TY”.
Hint: in C++, the std::ifstream class declared in fstream can be used to read from a file, and a good
way to read lines is with std::getline declared in string. In C, use fopen (and fclose) and fgets. In
C++, see std::string and its substr feature. In C, strncmp might be useful for pattern matching.
